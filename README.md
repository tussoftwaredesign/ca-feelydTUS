The Team Management Application was developed to facilitate the effective management of a soccer club. The application is something which can be used to allow coaches or team administrators to manage player administration, attendance tracking, and attendance reporting.
This application enables club managers/coaches to manage team players, monitor attendance for both matches and training sessions, and generate detailed statistical reports on player and match performance.
The application is a Console based application and it also allows the information to be saved via a file to the local disk.
